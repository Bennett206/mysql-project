# IT125 Final Project
### Different uses of databases and analyzing them with MySQL queries.

- For part 1 of the project, I created three tables with baseball statistics from the Mariners 2022 season. One table holds pitching data, one holds a game log, and the other holds ballpark data for that season. I created multiple queries to test the database and show the potential deeper analysis.

- For part 2 of the project, I created multiple tables within a database using SQL Workbench's diagram tool. I simulated a simple Produce Store business to keep track of Customer, Transaction and Employee data. With those tables I was able to make proper relationships to allow for smooth table joins and other query potential.

Please take a look at `MySQL_presentation.pdf` for a deeper understanding and step by step process of the project! This can be great for a beginner to get a small taste of the power of data analysis using SQL.
